# GoPro-Timestamp
The projects adds a timestamp to GoPro videos using Python and OpenCV.

For more information on the how the script works visit:

There are several different iterations of this basic function.  The base script is GoPro_timestamp.py.  GoPro_timestamp_filewalker adds extra functionality for batch processing videos.  Data from external sources can be added to the video, giving a basic heads up display using the GoPro_timestamper_w_external_data.py.  Finally the last python file combines the external data function with the batch processing function.
